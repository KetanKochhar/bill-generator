To use this project, you have two options. Firstly, you can explore the source code of the Python program, which can provide insights into its implementation. Secondly, you can directly install the software on Windows using the installer provided in the "installer" folder. Ensure that you also download the "images" folder for a seamless and error-free experience, as it contains the necessary images for generating the bills.

Once you have the software installed, follow these steps to create a petrol pump bill in the same size as those seen at actual petrol pumps:

1. Select an image by entering the corresponding number when prompted.
2. Enter the name of the petrol pump.
3. Provide the address of the petrol pump.
4. Input the vehicle number.
5. Specify the type of fuel used.
6. Enter the rate of the fuel.
7. Input the amount of fuel filled.
8. Finally, write the desired name for the generated .docx file in which the bill will be saved.

However, please note that there are a few drawbacks to be aware of. The program may generate the fuel quantity in liters as a floating-point number with more than two decimal places.
